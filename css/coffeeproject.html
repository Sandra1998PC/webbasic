                <h3>Coffee</h3>
                <p>Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain Coffea
                    species. From the coffee fruit, the seeds are separated to produce a stable, raw product: unroasted
                    green coffee.</p>

        <p id="p3">
            Espresso is a coffee-brewing method of Italian origin, in which a small amount of nearly boiling
            water is forced under 9–10 bars of pressure through finely-ground coffee beans. Espresso coffee can
            be made with a wide variety of coffee beans and roast degrees.

        <p id="p3">Doppio espresso is a double shot which is extracted using double the amount of ground coffee in a
            larger-sized portafilter basket. This results in 60 ml of drink, double the amount of a single shot
            espresso. Doppio is Italian multiplier, meaning "double".</p>

        <p id="p3">
            Dalgona coffee is a beverage made by whipping equal parts instant coffee powder, sugar, and hot water until
            it becomes creamy and then adding it to cold or hot milk. Occasionally, it is topped with coffee powder,
            cocoa, crumbled biscuits, or honey.

        <p id="p3">Caffè Americano is a type of coffee drink prepared by diluting an espresso with hot water, giving it
            a
            similar strength to, but different flavor from, traditionally brewed coffee. The strength of an Americano
            varies with the number of shots of espresso and the amount of water added.</p>

        <img src="./ca.jpg" alt="">

        <p>A cappuccino is an espresso-based coffee drink that originated in Italy, and is prepared with steamed milk
            foam. Variations of the drink involve the use of cream instead of milk, using non-dairy milk substitutes and
            flavoring with cinnamon or chocolate powder.</p>

        <h3>Cold Coffee</h3>
        <img src="./cold.jpg" alt="">
        <br><br><br>
        <p>Iced coffee is a coffee beverage served cold. It may be prepared either by brewing coffee in the normal way
            and then serving it over ice or in cold milk, or by brewing the coffee cold. In hot brewing, sweeteners and
            flavoring may be added before cooling, as they dissolve faster.</p>
