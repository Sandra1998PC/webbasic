                    Njanentha cheyyande, nirthan pattande?’ Murali asks helplessly when his mother curses him for the
                    shame he has brought to the family after a tussle at a family function. His alcohol use disorder is
                    affecting not just him, but his family and everyone related to him. He is basically a good person
                    and a good Samaritan, but everything he does ends up badly due to his unhealthy alcohol use.
